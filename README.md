# Machine-Learning
This repository consists of ML techniques used in various applications in the form of jupyter notebook, each notebook contains the corresponding julia code 
- learn2classifymany : Multiclass classification to classify handwritten digits using one-hot-encoding
- Background_subtraction : Remove the background noise from a video using SVDs
- learn2project : Used PCA and ICA factorizations to unmix mixed images and audio signals
- neural_networks : Used deep-neural networks and softmax to classify handwritten digits
